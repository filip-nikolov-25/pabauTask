Pabau Exercise - Filip Nikolov

-I used Next.js combined with Typescript and for styling Tailwind
-Also i implemented i18n for translation and a lot of filters to search and explore the Rick and Morty Characters.
-The filters for species are created dynamically. When you navigate to another page in the future, the filter is automatically generated for each card based on its species, -guaranteeing that no card is missed when filtering.
-Implemented infinite scroll when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page
-Reset button for reseting all filters
-Dynamic Filters: The app automatically generates filters for each species based on the cards available. You can filter characters by status, species, gender, and more.
-The name and origin filters are filtering by words from A to Z or Z to A,
-Status filters also work and can be combined with species filters..
-Added gender filter also can be combined
-Added AOS animations on the cards
-Created beautiful design and eye cathing with gradients, hover animations,animations on scroll etc...

Infinite Scroll: As you scroll to the bottom of the page, more characters will load automatically.
Filter Combination: You can combine multiple filters to narrow down your search.
Sorting: Sort characters by name or origin from A to Z or Z to A.
Reset Filters: A reset button allows you to clear all applied filters with one click.
AOS Animations: Smooth animations are applied when the cards appear on the page.
Responsive Design: The app is built with a beautiful and responsive design, with eye-catching gradients, hover animations, and other visual effects.
